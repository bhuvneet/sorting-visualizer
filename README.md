# sorting-visualizer

This Sorting Visualizer project leverages C++ with SLD2 library. It provides an interactive visualization of various sorting algorithms, making it easy to understand and compare their performances.

<b>Features</b>
<b>Interactive Visualization</b>: The Sorting Visualizer demonstrates the array being sorted following the selected sorting algorithm

<b>Multiple Algorithms</b>: User can choose from the following algorithms to visualize the array sort or compare sorting using two distinct algorithms

<b>Array Size</b>: The size of array can be modified between 20 to 2000. The lower and upper cap to number of elements is to ensure that the sort is visualized in a smooth manner and is easy to follow
